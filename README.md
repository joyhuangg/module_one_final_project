# Bread of the Wild: Recipe Generator

For our project in Module 1 at Flatiron School, we created a Recipe Generator in Ruby using SQLITE3 as our database. Inspired by the popular game The Legend of Zelda: Breathe of the Wild, we wanted a way to input ingredients from our inventory and get back a bunch of recipes in the game that we could make. Then we would be able to see all the possible recipes we could create using the ingredients that we currently had.
